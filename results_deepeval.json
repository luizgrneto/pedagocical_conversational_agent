Isso significa que MLOps é uma abordagem que busca automatizar e monitorar todos os passos do ciclo de vida de um sistema de aprendizado de máquina, desde a integração até a implantação e gerenciamento da infraestrutura.\n\nJá o Data Scientist é um profissional que se especializa em extrair insights valiosas a partir de grandes volumes de dados. Eles têm uma sólida formação em matemática, estatística e programação, e trabalham para analisar e interpretar dados para resolver problemas complexos e apoiar tomadas de decisão melhoradas dentro de uma organização.\n\nEm resumo, MLOps é um termo que se refere à prática de engenharia de ML, enquanto Data Scientist é um profissional que se especializa em trabalhar com dados. Embora haja some similarities between the two (e.g., both involve working with data), they have distinct roles and responsibilities.\n\nEspero que isso tenha ajudado a esclarecer a diferença entre MLOps e Data Scientist!",

      "MLOps Now - What is MLOps? Demystifying Machine Learning Operations\nTo understand MLOps, it’s essential to be familiar with the development\nlifecycle of data science projects. A typical data science project consists of\nseveral stages:\n1. Data acquisition: Obtaining raw data from various sources, such as\ndatabases, sensors, or external APIs.\n2. Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and structuring the data\nto prepare it for analysis.\n3. Feature engineering: Selecting the most relevant data attributes, or\n“features,” and converting them into a suitable format for ML\nalgorithms.\n4. Model training: Applying ML algorithms to the preprocessed data to\ncreate a predictive model.\n5. Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model and\nmaking adjustments to improve its accuracy.",

De acordo com o contexto, podemos ver que ambos compartilham objetivos semelhantes: unificar desenvolvimento de software e operações.\n\nDevOps é uma prática que combina desenvolvimento (Dev) e operações (Ops), visando reduzir o tempo entre mudanças de código e implantação. Isso é alcançado mediante a automação de processos como integração contínua, entrega contínua e deployment contínuo.\n\nJá MLOps é uma prática que combina desenvolvimento (Dev) e operações (Ops) específicas para sistemas de aprendizado de máquina (ML). Isso inclui gerenciamento de dados, desenvolvimento automatizado de modelos, geração de código, treinamento e re-treinamento de modelos, deployment contínuo e monitoramento de modelos.\n\nA principal diferença entre MLOps e DevOps é que MLOps se concentra especificamente em sistemas de aprendizado de máquina, enquanto DevOps é uma prática mais geral para desenvolvimento e operações de software. Portanto, podemos dizer que MLOps é um subconjunto de DevOps, aplicado ao contexto específico de aprendizado de máquina.\n\nEspero que isso tenha ajudado a esclarecer a diferença entre MLOps e DevOps!",

This practice provides benefits such as shortening the\ndevelopment cycles, increasing deployment velocity, and dependable releases. To achieve\nthese benefits, you introduce two concepts in the software system development:\nContinuous integration (CI) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)",
      "MLOps encompasses more than model construction and design. It includes data management, automated model development, code generation, model training and retraining, continuous model development, deployment, and model monitoring. Incorporating DevOps ideas into machine learning offers a shorter development cycle, improved quality control, and the ability to adapt to changing business needs.",
      "System administrators, data science teams, and other business units collaborate and communicate to foster a common understanding of how production models are created and maintained, much the same as DevOps does for software.

      "1 INTRODUCTION As Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly incorporated into software, a nascent sub-field called MLOps (short for ML Op- erations) has emerged to organize the “set of practices that aim to deploy and maintain ML models in production reliably and effi- ciently” . It is widely agreed that MLOps is hard. Anecdotal re- ports claim that 90% of ML models don’t make it to production ; others claim that 85% of ML projects fail to deliver value .",
      ". Feature Engineering and Model Experimentation. ML engi- neers typically focus on improving ML performance, measured via metrics such as accuracy or mean-squared-error. Experiments can be data-driven or model-driven; for example, an engineer can create a new feature or change the model architecture from tree-based to neural network-based. Model Evaluation and Deployment. A model is typically eval- uated by computing a metric (e.g., accuracy) over a collection of labeled data points hidden at training time, or a validation dataset, to see if its performance is better than what the currently-running production model achieved during its evaluation phase",
      ". Drift errors occur when the live data is from a seemingly different distribution than the training set; these happen relatively slowly over time. One pain point mentioned by the in- terviewees was that different types of data errors require different responses, and it was not easy to determine the appropriate re- sponse. Another issue was that requiring practitioners to manually define constraints on data quality (e.g., lower and upper bounds on values) was not sustainable over time, as employees with this knowledge left the organization."

Isso é um exemplo da virtude de versioning.\n\nAlém disso, como mencionado no contexto, os engenheiros preferem ferramentas que melhoram significativamente sua experiência em relação às Three Vs (Section 4.2), o que inclui a velocidade de iterar sobre ideias de recursos ou modelos (P14, P15).

Embora não tenha encontrado uma resposta específica sobre canary deployment no contexto fornecido, posso tentar ajudar com base nas informações disponíveis.\n\nNo contexto, vemos que a discussão está relacionada às práticas de avaliação da implantação de ML e ao processo de MLOps (Machine Learning Operations). A frase \"multi-stage pattern\" sugere que o processo de implantação pode ser dividido em várias etapas ou fases.\n\nEm geral, canary deployment é uma técnica de implantação de software que envolve a criação de um ambiente isolado para testar e avaliar um novo recurso ou versão antes de implantá-lo em produção. Isso ajuda a minimizar o risco de problemas e permite que os desenvolvedores monitorem o desempenho do novo recurso antes de expandir para todos os usuários.\n\nEmbora não tenha encontrado uma resposta específica sobre canary deployment no contexto, é provável que essa técnica seja aplicada ao processo de MLOps, especialmente quando se trata da implantação de modelos de aprendizado de máquina em produção. No entanto, como não há informações específicas sobre isso no contexto, não posso confirmar ou negar a existência de canary deployment em ML.\n\nSe você tiver mais informações ou contexto adicional, estou aqui para ajudar!",

In this section, you learn about concrete details of tasks like running a continuous training pipeline, de-\nploying a model, and monitoring predictive performance of the model.\n15\nMLOps processes take place on an integrated ML platform that has the required development and operations capa-\nbilities (described later). Infrastructure engineers can provision this type of platform in different environments (like\ndevelopment, test, staging, and production) using configuration management and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools\nlike Terraform. Each environment is configured with its own set of required compute resources, data access, and\nsubset of MLOps capability services.",
      "like Terraform. Each environment is configured with its own set of required compute resources, data access, and\nsubset of MLOps capability services.\nML development\nExperimentation is the core activity in ML development, where your data scientists can rapidly try several ideas for\ndata preparation and ML modeling. Experimentation starts when the ML use case is well defined, meaning that the\nfollowing questions have been answered:\nWhat is the task?\nHow can we measure business impact?\nWhat is the evaluation metric?\nFigure 5. The ML development process\n16\nWhat is the relevant data?\nWhat are the training and serving requirements?\nExperimentation aims to arrive at an effective prototype model for the ML use case at hand. In addition to experimen-\ntation, data scientists need to formalize their ML training procedures. They do this by implementing an end-to-end\npipeline, so that the procedures can be operationalized and run in production. Figure 5 shows the process of ML\ndevelopment."

The model is continually\nadjusted, and its performance is evaluated against a validation dataset to\nfine-tune its accuracy and effectiveness.\nSeveral techniques can be applied during the model training phase,\nincluding hyperparameter optimisation, cross-validation, and\nregularisation. Utilising the right combination of these methods helps",
      "1 INTRODUCTION As Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly incorporated into software, a nascent sub-field called MLOps (short for ML Op- erations) has emerged to organize the “set of practices that aim to deploy and maintain ML models in production reliably and effi- ciently” . It is widely agreed that MLOps is hard. Anecdotal re- ports claim that 90% of ML models don’t make it to production ; others claim that 85% of ML projects fail to deliver value .",
      ". Feature Engineering and Model Experimentation. ML engi- neers typically focus on improving ML performance, measured via metrics such as accuracy or mean-squared-error. Experiments can be data-driven or model-driven; for example, an engineer can create a new feature or change the model architecture from tree-based to neural network-based. Model Evaluation and Deployment. A model is typically eval- uated by computing a metric (e.g., accuracy) over a collection of labeled data points hidden at training time, or a validation dataset, to see if its performance is better than what the currently-running production model achieved during its evaluation phase",
      "high-level flow of control and on key inputs and outputs.\nFigure 3. The MLOps process\nThis is not a waterfall workflow that has to sequentially pass through all the processes. The processes can be\nskipped, or the flow can repeat a given phase or a subsequence of the processes. The diagram shows the following\nflow:\n1. The core activity during this ML development phase is experimentation. As data scientists and ML research-\ners prototype model architectures and training routines, they create labeled datasets, and they use features\nand other reusable ML artifacts that are governed through the data and model management process. The\n8\nprimary output of this process is a formalized training procedure, which includes data preprocessing, model\narchitecture, and model training settings.\n2.\nIf the ML system requires continuous training (repeated retraining of the model), the training procedure is"

Isso ajuda a evitar que o modelo se adapte excessivamente ao conjunto de dados de treinamento e não generalize bem para novos conjuntos de dados.\n\nEm resumo, separar treino e teste é uma boa prática em Machine Learning porque permite avaliar a performance do modelo de forma independente e evitar overfitting.",

Vou buscar informações no contexto para te dar uma resposta clara e informativa.\n\nDe acordo com o contexto, os pipelines de ML são usados para instrumentar, orquestrar e automatizar complexos treinamentos e previsões de ML em produção. Além disso, eles permitem coordenar diferentes componentes, onde cada componente realiza uma tarefa específica no pipeline.\n\nA resposta à pergunta é que os pipelines em ML são usados para:\n\n* Instrumentar e orquestrar complexos treinamentos e previsões de ML em produção;\n* Coordenar diferentes componentes para realizar tarefas específicas;\n* Automatizar processos e reduzir a necessidade de intervenções humanas;\n* Fornecer uma visão geral do pipeline e facilitar a detecção de erros e recuperação de falhas.\n\nAlém disso, os pipelines em ML também ajudam a gerenciar o conhecimento tribal não documentado entre colaboradores com mais experiência relacionada a específicos pipelines. Isso ajuda a manter a documentação atualizada e a evitar a perda de conhecimento importante.\n\nEspero que isso tenha ajudado!",

No entanto, podemos relacionar a discussão sobre MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) e o processo de desenvolvimento de modelos.\n\nEm geral, um modelo baseline refere-se ao modelo inicial ou padrão que serve como base para comparações subsequentes. Nesse sentido, é o modelo que você começa com, antes de fazer ajustes ou melhorias.\n\nNo contexto da discussão sobre MLOps, o modelo baseline pode ser visto como o modelo treinado e avaliado no passo 4 (Model training) do processo. Isso significa que o modelo baseline é o modelo inicialmente treinado e avaliado, antes de qualquer ajuste ou refinamento.\n\nPortanto, a resposta para sua pergunta é: Nenhuma informação disponível no contexto.",

You also\napply data transformations and feature engineering to the model that solves the target task. The output of this step are the data splits in the prepared format.\n4. Model training: The data scientist implements different algorithms with the prepared\ndata to train various ML models. In addition, you subject the implemented algorithms to hyperparameter tuning to get the best performing ML model. The output of this\nstep is a trained model.\n5. Model evaluation: The model is evaluated on a holdout test set\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets#Holdout_dataset) to evaluate",
      "8. Model monitoring: The model predictive performance is monitored to potentially\ninvoke a new iteration in the ML process.\nThe level of automation of these steps defines the maturity of the ML process, which\nreflects the velocity of training new models given new data or training new models given new implementations. The following sections describe three levels of MLOps, starting from\nthe most common level, which involves no automation, up to automating both ML and CI/CD pipelines.\nMLOps level 0: Manual process\nMany teams have data scientists and ML researchers who can build state-of-the-art\nmodels, but their process for building and deploying ML models is entirely manual.

We offer the following starting points.\nPrediction Bias. In a system that is working as intended, it should usually be the case that the distribution of predicted labels is equal to the distribution of observed labels. This is by no means a comprehensive test, as it can be met by a null model that simply predicts average values of label occurrences without regard to the input features. However, it is a surprisingly useful diagnostic, and changes in metrics such as this are often indicative of an issue that requires attention. For example, this method can help to detect cases in which the world behavior suddenly changes, making training distributions drawn from historical data no longer reﬂective of current reality. Slicing prediction bias by various dimensions isolate issues quickly, and can also be used for automated alerting.",

      "Data values skews: These skews are significant changes in the statistical properties of data, which means that data patterns are changing, and you need to trigger a retraining of the model to capture these changes.\nModel validation: This step occurs after you successfully train the model given the new data. You evaluate and validate the model before it's promoted to production. This offline model validation step consists of the following.\nProducing evaluation metric values using the trained model on a test dataset to assess the model's predictive quality.\nComparing the evaluation metric values produced by your newly trained model\nto the current model, for example, production model, baseline model, or other business-requirement models. You make sure that the new model produces better performance than the current model before promoting it to production."

Nesse sentido, o sistema de A/B testing para modelos consiste em introduzir o novo modelo ao lado do modelo antigo, com pesos definidos (ou seja, uma abordagem ponderada). Isso permite que você veja como o novo modelo se comporta em produção antes de comprometer-se com ele.\n\nNesse processo, um porcento determinado da tráfego é direcionado para o novo modelo, enquanto o restante continua a ser direcionado ao modelo antigo. Isso permite que você compare as performances dos dois modelos e escolha o melhor.\n\nEssa abordagem é especialmente útil quando você está trabalhando com modelos de aprendizado automático (ML) em produção, pois permite que você avalie a eficácia do novo modelo antes de substituir o modelo antigo. Além disso, o A/B testing ajuda a identificar os melhores modelos para uso em produção.\n\nEspero que isso tenha ajudado!",

Em seguida, eles podem criar um modelo challenger para testar se é possível melhorar a performance do modelo champion.\n\nPortanto, embora não haja uma definição explícita para \"champion\" e \"challenger\" no contexto fornecido, podemos relacioná-los ao processo de treinamento e avaliação de modelos de aprendizado automático.",
